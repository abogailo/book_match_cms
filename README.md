<h1>Book Match</h1>

<h5>User Experience - </h5>

<p>Book Match allows a user to pick favorited books from a list and view other users favorited books. If the other user has an allotted amount of the same favorited books, a message will appear announcing that the user is a match in the 'All Users' list. Users have the ability to delete their own account in the 'edit user' link. Users are able to sign in or out with either their GitHub account sign in -or- an email and created password. </p>

<h5>Admin User Experience - </h5>

<p>Along with the same features as all other users, the Admin will have the ability to create, edit, and remove books. 
They will also be able to remove users including their own account. For the sake of simplicity for this app, all users can change their admin rights in the edit user section.</p>
